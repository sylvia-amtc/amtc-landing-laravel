## 2026-02-17T02:22Z - US-002: Create Blade layout and reusable components (header, footer)
- Created resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php with Vite assets, meta tags, OG/Twitter cards, Schema.org JSON-LD, conditional analytics (GTM/GA4/Hotjar)
- Created resources/views/components/header.blade.php with nav (logo, Solutions, Compare, Resources, Get Started CTA, mobile menu)
- Created resources/views/components/footer.blade.php with company info, links (privacy/terms as named routes), social icons
- Added analytics config to config/services.php (gtm, ga4, hotjar reading from env)
- Added placeholder routes for privacy and terms in routes/web.php
- Created resources/views/test-layout.blade.php for testing layout rendering
- Created tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php with 10 tests
- All 18 tests pass, build succeeds, view:cache succeeds
- Files: resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/views/components/header.blade.php, resources/views/components/footer.blade.php, config/services.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php
- **Learnings:** Blade interprets `@context` and `@type` in JSON-LD as directives — must escape with `@@context`/`@@type`. Anonymous components via `<x-header />` work with files in views/components/.

## 2026-02-17T02:32Z - US-003: Build landing page hero and problem sections
- Created resources/views/pages/home.blade.php extending layouts.app
- Ported hero section: badge with pulse animation, h1 with gradient-text, subtitle with pricing, CTA buttons, trust bar
- Ported problem section: 4 cards (Crushing Costs, Endless Setup, Vendor Chaos, Weather Roulette)
- Updated routes/web.php to serve pages.home at / with named route 'home'
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php
- **Learnings:** Original HTML uses slightly different card titles than story description (Endless Setup vs Slow Setup, Vendor Chaos vs Vendor Lock-in, Weather Roulette vs Limited Reach) - ported exact original content
