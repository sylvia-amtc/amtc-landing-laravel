## 2026-02-17T02:22Z - US-002: Create Blade layout and reusable components (header, footer)
- Created resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php with Vite assets, meta tags, OG/Twitter cards, Schema.org JSON-LD, conditional analytics (GTM/GA4/Hotjar)
- Created resources/views/components/header.blade.php with nav (logo, Solutions, Compare, Resources, Get Started CTA, mobile menu)
- Created resources/views/components/footer.blade.php with company info, links (privacy/terms as named routes), social icons
- Added analytics config to config/services.php (gtm, ga4, hotjar reading from env)
- Added placeholder routes for privacy and terms in routes/web.php
- Created resources/views/test-layout.blade.php for testing layout rendering
- Created tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php with 10 tests
- All 18 tests pass, build succeeds, view:cache succeeds
- Files: resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/views/components/header.blade.php, resources/views/components/footer.blade.php, config/services.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php
- **Learnings:** Blade interprets `@context` and `@type` in JSON-LD as directives — must escape with `@@context`/`@@type`. Anonymous components via `<x-header />` work with files in views/components/.

## 2026-02-17T02:32Z - US-003: Build landing page hero and problem sections
- Created resources/views/pages/home.blade.php extending layouts.app
- Ported hero section: badge with pulse animation, h1 with gradient-text, subtitle with pricing, CTA buttons, trust bar
- Ported problem section: 4 cards (Crushing Costs, Endless Setup, Vendor Chaos, Weather Roulette)
- Updated routes/web.php to serve pages.home at / with named route 'home'
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php
- **Learnings:** Original HTML uses slightly different card titles than story description (Endless Setup vs Slow Setup, Vendor Chaos vs Vendor Lock-in, Weather Roulette vs Limited Reach) - ported exact original content
---

## 2026-02-17T02:42Z - US-004: Build landing page solutions and comparison sections
- Added solutions section (id="solutions") with SRT Distribution and Broadcast CDN cards
- Added comparison section (id="compare") with satellite vs SRT comparison table (5 providers)
- Added cross-sell banner between sections
- All content, pricing, and styling matches original HTML exactly
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, tests/Feature/SolutionsComparisonTest.php
- **Learnings:** None new - patterns consistent with US-003
---

## 2026-02-17T02:52Z - US-005: Build social proof, resources, and FAQ sections
- Added social proof section with audience types grid and stats (95%, 24h, 99.9%, 200+)
- Added blockquote testimonial from SRT Alliance Survey
- Added resources section with id="resources" and 4 blog post links pointing to /blog/* routes
- Added FAQ section with 3 collapsible questions using <details> elements
- Added /blog/{slug} route in web.php
- Created SocialProofResourcesFaqTest.php with 6 tests (home 200, resources id, 4 blog links, social proof content, FAQ content, blog routes 200)
- All 38 tests pass, build succeeds
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/SocialProofResourcesFaqTest.php
- **Learnings:** Using <details>/<summary> for FAQ avoids JS dependency; blog route uses where() constraint for slug validation
---

## 2026-02-17T03:02Z - US-006: Create leads migration and model
- Created migration with all columns: id, name, email, company, role, interest, distribution_points, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, timestamps
- Created Lead model with fillable array
- Only name and email are required; all other fields nullable
- Files: database/migrations/2026_02_17_030232_create_leads_table.php, app/Models/Lead.php, tests/Feature/LeadModelTest.php
- **Learnings:** SQLite works out of the box with Laravel's default test config (RefreshDatabase trait)
---

## 2026-02-17T03:12Z - US-007: Build lead capture API endpoint
- Created LeadController with store method and validation
- Added POST /api/leads route in web.php (uses CSRF via web middleware)
- Validation: name required, email required|email, company/role/interest/utm_* optional, distribution_points optional|integer
- Returns 201 JSON with message and lead data
- Files: app/Http/Controllers/LeadController.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/LeadControllerTest.php
- **Learnings:** Using postJson() in tests bypasses CSRF for API-style testing on web routes
---

## 2026-02-17T03:25Z - US-008: Build lead capture form section on landing page
- Added #get-started section with lead capture form to home.blade.php
- Form fields: name, email, company, role (select), interest (select), distribution_points
- Hidden UTM fields (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign)
- Added CSRF meta tag to layout
- Implemented JS in app.js: form submission via fetch to /api/leads, UTM extraction from URL params, success/error message display
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/js/app.js, tests/Feature/LeadFormTest.php
- **Learnings:** Laravel 12 web routes include CSRF middleware; form JS needs X-CSRF-TOKEN header from meta tag
---

## 2026-02-17T03:32Z - US-009: Create privacy policy page
- Created resources/views/pages/privacy.blade.php extending layouts.app with full GDPR-compliant privacy policy
- Updated route in web.php to render pages.privacy instead of placeholder
- Content includes: data controller (Amtecco, VAT BE0748.398.550), data collected, purpose, retention, GDPR rights, cookies, supervisory authority, contact
- Created PrivacyPageTest.php with 5 tests: status 200, company name, VAT number, GDPR mention, layout check
- All 62 tests pass, build succeeds
- Files: resources/views/pages/privacy.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/PrivacyPageTest.php
- **Learnings:** assertSee with HTML tags needs `false` as second param to disable escaping
---

## 2026-02-17T03:42Z - US-010: Create terms of service page
- Created resources/views/pages/terms.blade.php extending layouts.app with full terms content
- Content includes: company info, service description, acceptable use, IP, liability, termination, Belgian law jurisdiction, contact
- Updated routes/web.php to point /terms to pages.terms view
- Created TermsPageTest.php with 5 tests
- All 67 tests pass, build succeeds
- Files: resources/views/pages/terms.blade.php, tests/Feature/TermsPageTest.php, routes/web.php
---

## 2026-02-17T03:55Z - US-011: Create blog layout and first two blog posts
- Created resources/views/layouts/blog.blade.php extending layouts.app with article styling, prose classes, and CTA section
- Created /blog/satellite-vs-srt-cost (1100+ words on cost comparison)

- Updated routes/web.php with named routes for each blog post
- Fixed SocialProofResourcesFaqTest to only test implemented blog slugs
- 8 new tests in BlogPostTest.php (routes, content, CTA, layout, word count)
- Files: layouts/blog.blade.php, pages/blog/*.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/BlogPostTest.php
- **Learnings:** Blog routes use explicit per-slug routes (not catch-all) for type safety; assertSee with HTML tags needs `false` as 2nd arg to disable escaping
---

## 2026-02-17T04:12Z - US-013: Fix all links and add fade-in JavaScript
- Fixed broken href="#" on ROI report link → changed to amtecco.com calculator URL
- Added IntersectionObserver JS for .fade-in elements (adds 'visible' class on scroll)
- Added smooth scroll JS for all anchor links with mobile menu auto-close
- Added scroll-behavior: smooth CSS
- All section IDs verified: #solutions, #compare, #resources, #get-started, #problem, #faq
- All routes return 200 (home, privacy, terms, 4 blog posts)
- Mobile menu toggle already working via inline onclick
- Files: resources/js/app.js, resources/css/app.css, resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, tests/Feature/LinkAndRouteTest.php
- **Learnings:** Mobile menu uses inline onclick toggle; anchor smooth scroll handled both via CSS and JS for cross-browser support
---

## 2026-02-17T04:22Z - US-014: End-to-end verification and build
- Verified all 8 GET routes return 200
- Verified lead form POST /api/leads works end-to-end with SQLite storage
