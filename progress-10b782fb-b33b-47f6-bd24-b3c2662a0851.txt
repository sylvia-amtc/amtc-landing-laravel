## 2026-02-17T02:22Z - US-002: Create Blade layout and reusable components (header, footer)
- Created resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php with Vite assets, meta tags, OG/Twitter cards, Schema.org JSON-LD, conditional analytics (GTM/GA4/Hotjar)
- Created resources/views/components/header.blade.php with nav (logo, Solutions, Compare, Resources, Get Started CTA, mobile menu)
- Created resources/views/components/footer.blade.php with company info, links (privacy/terms as named routes), social icons
- Added analytics config to config/services.php (gtm, ga4, hotjar reading from env)
- Added placeholder routes for privacy and terms in routes/web.php
- Created resources/views/test-layout.blade.php for testing layout rendering
- Created tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php with 10 tests
- All 18 tests pass, build succeeds, view:cache succeeds
- Files: resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/views/components/header.blade.php, resources/views/components/footer.blade.php, config/services.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/LayoutComponentTest.php
- **Learnings:** Blade interprets `@context` and `@type` in JSON-LD as directives — must escape with `@@context`/`@@type`. Anonymous components via `<x-header />` work with files in views/components/.

## 2026-02-17T02:32Z - US-003: Build landing page hero and problem sections
- Created resources/views/pages/home.blade.php extending layouts.app
- Ported hero section: badge with pulse animation, h1 with gradient-text, subtitle with pricing, CTA buttons, trust bar
- Ported problem section: 4 cards (Crushing Costs, Endless Setup, Vendor Chaos, Weather Roulette)
- Updated routes/web.php to serve pages.home at / with named route 'home'
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/HomePageTest.php
- **Learnings:** Original HTML uses slightly different card titles than story description (Endless Setup vs Slow Setup, Vendor Chaos vs Vendor Lock-in, Weather Roulette vs Limited Reach) - ported exact original content
---

## 2026-02-17T02:42Z - US-004: Build landing page solutions and comparison sections
- Added solutions section (id="solutions") with SRT Distribution and Broadcast CDN cards
- Added comparison section (id="compare") with satellite vs SRT comparison table (5 providers)
- Added cross-sell banner between sections
- All content, pricing, and styling matches original HTML exactly
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, tests/Feature/SolutionsComparisonTest.php
- **Learnings:** None new - patterns consistent with US-003
---

## 2026-02-17T02:52Z - US-005: Build social proof, resources, and FAQ sections
- Added social proof section with audience types grid and stats (95%, 24h, 99.9%, 200+)

- Added resources section with id="resources" and 4 blog post links pointing to /blog/* routes
- Added FAQ section with 3 collapsible questions using <details> elements
- Added /blog/{slug} route in web.php
- Created SocialProofResourcesFaqTest.php with 6 tests (home 200, resources id, 4 blog links, social proof content, FAQ content, blog routes 200)
- All 38 tests pass, build succeeds
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/SocialProofResourcesFaqTest.php
- **Learnings:** Using <details>/<summary> for FAQ avoids JS dependency; blog route uses where() constraint for slug validation

## 2026-02-17T03:02Z - US-006: Create leads migration and model
- Created migration with all columns: id, name, email, company, role, interest, distribution_points, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, timestamps
- Created Lead model with fillable array

- Files: database/migrations/2026_02_17_030232_create_leads_table.php, app/Models/Lead.php, tests/Feature/LeadModelTest.php
- **Learnings:** SQLite works out of the box with Laravel's default test config (RefreshDatabase trait)
---

## 2026-02-17T03:12Z - US-007: Build lead capture API endpoint
- Created LeadController with store method and validation
- Added POST /api/leads route in web.php (uses CSRF via web middleware)
- Validation: name required, email required|email, company/role/interest/utm_* optional, distribution_points optional|integer
- Returns 201 JSON with message and lead data
- Files: app/Http/Controllers/LeadController.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/LeadControllerTest.php
- **Learnings:** Using postJson() in tests bypasses CSRF for API-style testing on web routes
---

## 2026-02-17T03:25Z - US-008: Build lead capture form section on landing page
- Added #get-started section with lead capture form to home.blade.php

- Implemented JS in app.js: form submission via fetch to /api/leads, UTM extraction from URL params, success/error message display
- Files: resources/views/pages/home.blade.php, resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php, resources/js/app.js, tests/Feature/LeadFormTest.php
- **Learnings:** Laravel 12 web routes include CSRF middleware; form JS needs X-CSRF-TOKEN header from meta tag
---

- All 62 tests pass, build succeeds
- Files: resources/views/pages/privacy.blade.php, routes/web.php, tests/Feature/PrivacyPageTest.php

---
